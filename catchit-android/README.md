# CatchIt

CatchIt is a Android Library to monitor exceptions and sync with dedicated node-js server.

  - Support caught and uncaught exceptions
  - Easy integration
  - Dedicated node-js code to handle exceptions
  - Unit & Instrumented tests

# Todos (future features)
  
  - Add CatchIt web dashboard (to view exceptions and generating API tokens)
  - Add Activity lifecycle logs as well so we can track users trail before exceptions was thrown (to understand user footprint)
  - Let developer add custom attributes to users using his app so he can identifies user (by using third_party_id or email address)
  - Add CatchItOptions.Builder so developers can customize CatchIt behvaiour such as chaging backend URL and sync interval.
  - Differentiating between caught and uncaught exceptions
 
 # Notes
 - CatchIt uses less 3rd parties libraries more than usual because we want the library to be little as possible
 - You'll see Builder pattern for constructing new objects, this pattern let us test objects dependenceis on ease and is well used by Google in Android API

# Future dev improvements
  
  - Adding "handshake" API call every app launch (or just on first exceptions sync) to send App&Device info as for now the data being sent on every exceptions sync
  - Create "Interruptable" Executor and Worker (more info on AppExecutors.java)
  - Protecting internal library classes from container app access (this is a common issue in SDK development) as we don't want any unintended usage of library (we can achieve this by few solutions, making all our classes private and then organizing flat package structure or by using Reflection to use private classes)
  - Add Repository interface and Implementation
  - Provide my own custom Executor for Retrofit (Networking) as I want full control on network tasks pooling
  - Adding more tests


## Third party libraries


* [Retrofit] - A type-safe HTTP client for Android and Java.
* [Room] - Persistence library that provides an abstraction layer over SQLite.
* [JUnit] -  Unit testing framework for Java.
* [Espresso] - UI testing framework for Android powered devices.

This text you see here is *actually* written in Markdown! To get a feel for Markdown's syntax, type some text into the left window and watch the results in the right.

### Tech

Dillinger uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [AngularJS] - HTML enhanced for web apps!
* [Ace Editor] - awesome web-based text editor
* [markdown-it] - Markdown parser done right. Fast and easy to extend.
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - fast node.js network app framework [@tjholowaychuk]
* [Gulp] - the streaming build system
* [Breakdance](https://breakdance.github.io/breakdance/) - HTML to Markdown converter
* [jQuery] - duh

And of course Dillinger itself is open source with a [public repository][dill]
 on GitHub.

### Installation

Dillinger requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v4+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ cd dillinger
$ npm install -d
$ node app
```

For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md][PlDb] |
| GitHub | [plugins/github/README.md][PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md][PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md][PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md][PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md][PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantaneously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version} .
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud

See [KUBERNETES.md](https://github.com/joemccann/dillinger/blob/master/KUBERNETES.md)


### Todos

 - Write MORE Tests
 - Add Night Mode

  - Drag and drop markdown and HTML files into Dillinger
  - Export documents as Markdown, HTML and PDF

Markdown is a lightweight markup language based on the formatting conventions that people naturally use in email.  As [John Gruber] writes on the [Markdown site][df1]
